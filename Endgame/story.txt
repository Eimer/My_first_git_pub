, greetings from the Dungeon Master.
You are a warrior. After the battle for you city, you have been locked up in the dungeon with ancient monsters. Try to get out if it alive!

Use arrows to move around. You can hit <1> to attack monsters if you are close enough*, but watch out - they can hit back!

*close enough means two cells away, but some cool swords can hit from a three-cell distance. Legend has it such swords, once owned by fallen knights, can be found in these gloomy places. But why did these knights fall though?...
